RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

# Redirect all remaining requests to index.html, while preserving query string parameters
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /index.html [L,QSA]

# Explanation:
# This .htaccess configuration ensures that all requests not for actual files or directories
# and not for specific resources like favicon.ico or assets will be redirected to index.html.
# This is useful for single-page applications like React apps, where the client-side router
# handles routing instead of the server.
