# The robots.txt file is a plain text file that provides instructions to web
# crawlers, like search engine bots, on how to crawl and index the pages of
# your website. It's a way to communicate with these crawlers and guide them
# through your site.

User-agent: *
Disallow:

# This example has two lines:
# 1. User-agent: * - This line specifies that the rules that follow apply to all
#    web crawlers (the * is a wildcard that matches any user agent).
# 2. Disallow: - This line tells the web crawlers that they are allowed to crawl
#    and index all pages on the site (an empty Disallow directive means no
#    restrictions).

# To create more specific rules, follow these steps:
# 1. Start with the "User-agent" line to specify the web crawler the rule applies
#    to (use * for all crawlers or specify a specific crawler's name).
# 2. Add "Disallow" lines to specify the parts of your site that you want to block
#    from crawling.
# 3. (Optional) Add "Allow" lines to specify exceptions to the Disallow rules.

# Remember to update your robots.txt file as needed to ensure that you're guiding
# web crawlers effectively through your site. Place the robots.txt file in the
# root directory of your site (e.g., https://example.site/robots.txt) so that
# crawlers can find it easily.

# Note that not all web crawlers follow the rules set in robots.txt, and the file
# is publicly accessible, so don't use it to hide sensitive information. It's
# meant to guide well-behaved crawlers, like search engine bots, in indexing
# your site.
