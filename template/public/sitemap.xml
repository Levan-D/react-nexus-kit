<!-- 
A sitemap is an XML file that lists the URLs of a website to help search engines like Google discover and index its content. It serves as a "map" for search engines to find and prioritize your site's pages.

To create a sitemap, follow these steps:
1. Start with the basic sitemap structure (like the example below).
2. For each URL you want to include, create a new <url> entry within the <urlset> element.
3. Within each <url> entry, add the following elements:
   - <loc>: The ABSOLUTE URL of the page (e.g., https://example.site/page1)
   - <lastmod>: The date the page was last modified, in the format YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2023-04-17)
   - <changefreq>: How often the content is expected to change (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, never)
   - <priority>: A value between 0.0 and 1.0 that indicates the priority of the URL relative to other URLs on your site (1.0 is the highest priority)

Remember to add more URLs as needed to ensure that all important pages on your site are included in the sitemap.

After creating your sitemap, submit it to search engines like Google through their respective webmaster tools to help them discover and index your content more efficiently.
